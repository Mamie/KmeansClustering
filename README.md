KmeansClustering
================

This is week 7 assignment of [Coursera Machine Learning] (http://www.coursera.org/course/ml) class.

Summary
------
In the first part of the program, the K-means clustering algorithm is implemented and applied to compress an image. In the second part, principal component analysis is performed to find a low-dimensional representation of face images.

#### K-means Clustering
Completed methods are summarized below:

 findClosestCentroids.m - Find closest centroids (used in K-means) <br\ >
 computeCentroids.m - Compute centroid means (used in K-means) <br\ >
 kMeansInitCentroids.m - Initialization for K-means centroids <br\ >

Starter codes are listed below:

ex7.m - Octave/Matlab script for the first exercise on K-means <br\ >
ex7data2.mat - Example Dataset for K-means <br\ >
drawLine.m - Draws a line over an exsiting figure <br\ >
plotDataPoints.m - Initialization for K-means centroids <br\ >
plotProgresskMeans.m - Plots each step of K-means as it proceeds <br\ >
runkMeans.m - Runs the K-means algorithm <br\ >

#### Principle component analysis
Completed methods are summarized below:
 pca.m - Perform principal component analysis <br\ >
 projectData.m - Projects a data set into a lower dimensional space <br\ >
 recoverData.m - Recovers the original data from the projection <br\ >
 
 Starter codes are listed below:
 ex7 pca.m - Octave/Matlab script for the second exercise on PCA <br\ >
 ex7data1.mat - Example Dataset for PCA <br\ >
 ex7faces.mat - Faces Dataset <br\ >
 bird small.png - Example Image <br\ >
 displayData.m - Displays 2D data stored in a matrix <br\ >
